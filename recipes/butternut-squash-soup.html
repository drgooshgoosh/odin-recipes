    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This creamy risotto is infused with the rich, nutty flavor of roasted
      butternut squash and aromatic sage. The creamy texture and slight
      sweetness of the squash balance beautifully with the savory Parmesan and
      buttery rice. Perfect for a cozy evening during the fall season.
